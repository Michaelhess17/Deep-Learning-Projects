My side of the room does not have pictures.  i prefer having white walls in teh room so that is looks peaceful and quiet. I also have a carpet on the floor. This makes the room more welcoming and helps us during winters. We also have a candy stand right next to the beds where we store all our candies and eat them on our way in and out. They look very welcoming so keeping them helps. This also helps us energize when needed. The room also has some mirrors. These are right in front of the closet on the door, so we can see ourselves when needed. the mirrors are right in front of the bed and give a wide space to look into. There are also 4 in total of the mirrors. These make the room look bigger and helps us see into them from lmost anywhere in the room . There are also two cabinet spaces.

The kitchen has white tiled floors, old from decades of use. some of the space between tiles is empty due to the rotting away of the caulking that was supposed to keep it together. Moving 4 steps forward, the wooden countertop sits with a blue police officer cookie jar on the left side and a white mixer in the middle. The staineless steel sink is in the middle, leaky handle and all. Just to theright of that is a drying rack for dishes, next to the microwave. Diretly across from the microwave is the white fridge with many family pictures an receipts/notes on it. There is a doorway that sits right next to the fridge. This doorway leads to the dining room, where a rectangular wooden table sits on top of hardwood floor. The chair farthest from the doorway has a rip in the back of it, from when my brother ran his knee through it. On that same wooden floor is the living room. This living room was the family space before we remodeled in 2005 and added a larger lounging space. This living room has 2 couches, one is a single person chair while the other can fit about 3. The fabric that makes up the chair and the pillows is grey, with green leaves and vines being the only design on it. Next to the larger couch is the mantle, which sits directly above the fireplace. The mantle holds about five candles, as well as a crystal bowl that my mother got as a present when she went to college. Right above the mantle is a large mirror with a wooden border. The small wooden table that sits between the two couches has many crayon marks on it, work from the hands of my brothers and I.

Inside my furniture was always moving; I always got tired of seeing the same thing so I often moved my furniture around. The one thing that I loved about my room was the great amount of light that it received. Light always flooded in through my white and blue curtains.

I did not want to do this as I had all my friends at my current school and was happy where I was. I made this very clear to them, but they still went around researching different private schools for me to go to. Once again, I voiced my opinion but they did not listen to me. I felt ignored, and that made me incredibly angry. I let them know that I felt that I should have a greater input into where I choose to go to school, as it is my life. However, they did not listen to me. Instead, they told me that we were going to an open house later that night at the school that they liked the most. My stomach turned in that moment because I did not know what I would be able to do without my friends. Later that night, we went to the open house. The school was centered in some dilapidated office buildings in the suburbs of the city, and I immediately grew to dislike them. We walked into the cafeteria, where they were holding the open house, and it smelled like old food. I'm not sure why I remember that specific aspect, but it does help reflect my sentiment towards this situation as a whole. I barely listened to anything that the president of the school said as 
a protest towards my parents' lack of hearing out my issues. The open house ended, and I was as underwhelmed as I was before we arrived. My parents explained that they thought this school would be a great fit for me. I vehemently disagreed. Instead of listening to me, my parents chose to set up an entrance interview and submit a deposit. Later that week, I was dragged to the interview ",1.92,574.474,600.007,15,286,363,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,413,349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,3,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,1,3,2,2,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Angry,Angry

At my school we had to run through the graduation ceremony many times prior to the actual ceremony, we practiced songs that we would sing for multiple months. The actual graduation ceremony was such a happy time because it signified not only the fact that we were graduating, but also the end of all the practices. It was also one of the last times that we would all be together as a class. After graduation we had a time where anyone can come and give congradualtions in the form of a lei, which is a necklace made of flowers. THis was fun to see all the people that I know and just have time to enjoy the time with them. After that we had a night called project grad, where we stay at this event room all night and there was some concerts and inflatable bouncy castles and games that we could play, there was also really good food. It was a fun night to just spend with all my highschool friends one last time as many people were going to leave for summer trips or summer classes soon after graduation. It was kind of sad at the same time to be celebrating the ending of an era of our lives, but it was a very exciting night as well. That night is memorable because we were not allowed to have our phones or anything with us, so it forced us to interact with eachother the entire night. The concerts were very good as well, people at my school knew people who were able to get The Green and Kalohe Kai to perform for us. They are two very popular bands in Hawaii.

The races went on and a majority of our athletes were doing really well and by the end of the meet they announced we were state champions. The state championship came down to the very last race because of how tight the scores were and our team had to do well in order to win the overall title. And we ended up completing our task and winning the entire thing. The best part we were all excited for was what our rings were going to look like and all of us thought about the designs and how it would be a symbol of what we accomplished together. Everyone in that moment was happy and just being around all of these people that were happy for you because of your accomplishments creates an overall positive environment. It was a moment of celebration with my teammates and best friends because of all of the hard work we have put in over the 4 years and seeing all of that pay off with a state championship was one we will never forget for the rest of our lives. Standing on the podium as they announced our school as state champions made me forget about everything else going on in life and all i could do was smile as i stared into the packed stadium with everyone cheering for us. This was also the last race we ever ran in high school sports so continuing to see the hard work pay off truly did mean alot. Before high school I set a goal to win a state championship, and honestly the last thing i expected to win it in was track, but rather football or basketball. Even today it is a memory i can look back on our texts my friends about and we will  still smile about it and talk about individual races or what it took to be state champs. Going back to the school will be the best part to see the giant banner outside of the football stadium that has all of our names on it saying we are state champs.

It was a symbol of my grandmothers love and presence in my life. This is mostly why it made me furious when she lost it. This incident influenced my emotions and I was extremely angry. My anger consumed me and I couldnt think of anything except that bracelet and the attachment I had to it. I could not do anything, I was just so frustrated. Even though I knew I shouldnt be sad over materialistic things, I was just in a position where everything annoyed me. I didnt feel like talking to anyone and I didnt talk to my sister for days. I know i might have been irrational but at that moment I felt I had no control over my emotions. Also, I was more angry at how my sister was responding to that situation.

It is a pretty populated area. My house was huge and had ten bedrooms. You could get lost if you did not know where you were going. As soon as you walked into the house, the winding staircase took you up to the second and third floors. They were white calcetta marble that felt cold on my small feet when I woke up in the morning. My room was connected through sliding doors with both of my sisters. My parents' room was on the third floor alone. They really needed their away time from us three girls when they would sleep because we were already a lot to handle. Our backyard had a pool, jacuzzi, trampoline, swing set, and a fire pit. My friends would come over all of the time to make s'mores. It was a very social setting. The kitchen had a massive pantry with every kind of snack you could imagine. My mom cooked every day so the kitchen was always quite busy, but smelt so good that it would go all the way up into the bedrooms upstairs. Our TV room had reclining chairs, resembling that of a movie theatre with a huge screen. Mama would make us popcorn before we would turn on a movie. The gym was in the basement and it had a treadmill, elliptical, yoga area, and weight rack. My mom spent a lot of her time there. She is a very fit mom and I strive to be her when I am older.

We had all recently experienced a great loss together and it was the first time in a long time that we had decided to go for a night out and try to enjoy ourselves. We went to see one of our favorite performers together and we spent the entire night just really enjoying the music and each others company. What made that event so happy was that it made me realize how much I had to be grateful for and that even after a tragic event, you can still have moments of pure joy. I think this event also brought so much happiness because of the people I was with. Dancing with them and having the best time together was a way for us to release a lot of the stress and pain and anger we had been feeling and finally let go of those negative emotions. And the fact that we did this together is also what made this moment so special and so happy. I would also say this was one of the happiest moments of my life because amidst a lot of confusion and sad events going on at the time, my friends and I were able to live in the moment and truly be present for the event. It wasn't that we had forgotten what had happened or what we would have to face after we left the concert, but that we were able to put our attention on what was happening around us and on each other. It was this overwhelming sense of love and gratitude I think that made the experience one of the happiest of my life. Another thing that I think made the experience so happy was that it was so easy to do. My friends and I all suffer from anxiety sometimes and so it becomes difficult to engage in social situations like concerts. But after we made it there and really started enjoying ourselves, that anxiety went away.

I attended a Montessori school for my elementary education, a rather expensive institution, but one my parents felt justified the money they invested on their three children. Where I grew up in suburban Southern California, there were not a lot of wealthy minorities. We were, well, the minority. This difference was made exceedingly clear to me almost every day, as I was consistently taunted for my darker skin, foreign accent, and weird meals. Then, I never understood why I was the target, just that the insults and fists flew at me relentlessly all day, everyday. Sitting on the ground working on whatever assignment it was, the boys around me started poking fun at the extra weight I had. Getting sick of it, I threatened to headbutt one of them if he did not cease this torment. They all laughed and started making jokes about how I would just loose my glasses and I would be an easier target to pummel and on they went laughing, poking, shoving.

I remember exactly that day. I was in English class back in my high school. The class was fairly so boring so I chose to mess around with my phone.Then, one email notification popped up be like check your admission result with Pitzer College. I was not sure back then if i should check it because I was so afraid to know if i got rejected. Pitzer only admits a few people in China every year so the admission rate is fairly low for Chinese international students. But regardless, I clicked that button and I checked. I got in! I screamed in front of the whole class because I was overwhelmed by my pure joy. I started shaking and ran out of the class to call my parents. I checked multiple times on the website to make sure I was not seeing some error. I was so happy to know that I got admitted because Pitzer College is my dream school and I was the only one in my class who applied for a liberal arts college back then. Even though only a few people know how prestigious Pitzer is, I was still very happy since my hard work got payed off. A few days ago before checking the result of Pitzer, I got rejected from other bigger universities. I remembered I was so upset and sad and thought myself as a total loser. But at that moment of me knowing I got into my dream school, I left behind all the sadness. My parents were proud of me as well and that made me even happier. Because coming from a very conservative family, getting them to understand the concept of a liberal arts college is tough. But finally getting into one can finally show them that I made it and I got to experience the finest higher education in America. On the other hand, getting  their recognition was a big deal for me as well and that indeed adding on my happiness. I felt like I finally accomplished something great and my parents would think of me differently.

We fought this summer and our friendship has been impacted since then. We are not the same in the way we approach each other and behave around each other. We tend to hold back and not be real with each other. This made me angry and we had an argument about it over break. We wern't aggressive but rather were sad about the situation. We are both extremely passionate individuals and we deal with conflict passionately. 

We were dancing at a club in San Diego and got into an argument. We both blame each other and hold each other responsible .for our friendship not being the same anymore. That is probably why we are angry at each other. More than anything else, we are passive aggressive towards one another. My emotions are severely impacted by this whole situation given that I am a very sensitive person. I tend to be extremely sensitive in situations as such and that makes me overthink. With this particular event, I think I just overthought throughout and felt like I needed to change who I am to make my friend feel more comfortable around me. That is not how we both see our friendship and the fact that we confronted each other in the summer has made us more wary around each other. 

At this point, I feel extremely sad and confused because I do not know whether I can regain the friendship that I once shared with this friend and whether I will be able to pick back up with her from where I once was. I am worried that this event could have changed the dynamic of our friendship. I have also realized the circumstantial nature of friendships and relationships. Things change based on environment and now that I am at college, and not back home in New Delhi, my dynamic with this individual has changed significantly. It is always hard to recognize change and accept it. Change is scary and unpredictable and makes you feel a lack of security. That is the overarching emotion that I feel at this point because I am not secure in the status of our friendship and neither is my friend. There is no point in constantly bringing up instances from the past and attempting to salvage a friendship if the same argument continues to repeat itself. I need to realize that and act accordingly. 

I think I am at a stage in life where I am more self-aware and confident in my decision making.

It has three bedrooms. The attic upstairs has been turned into a bedroom, which is now mine. We have 2 bathrooms. The first room when you walk through the front door is the living room. It is quite large with picture frames of my family. The next room is the dining room, which has different tiling than the living room. We have large windows and a glass table at the center. There is also a large cabinet with a lot of random stuff in it. Next to the dining room on the right is the bathroom. There is a shower and toilet and sink. It is pretty small. To the right of the dining room is also a bedroom, which my sister and I used to share. But it is now only hers. It's a large room. Growing up, it was painted pink and has a tall cabinet with a television on top and a lot of stuffed animals all around. Now, there is a large queen sized bed and a desk. It is painted gray and looks much less ""childish."" Moving on from that section of the house, there is the kitchen. The kitchen is brown and green. It is pretty small, but it has a stove, a pretty large refrigerator, and a lot of cabinets. Our fridge typically has popsicles in it because my mom knew how much we loved those growing up. Our cabinets are also filled with colorful bowls that are probably 10 years old and should be replaced, but I like to eat cereal out of those every morning so my mom has kept them (even though I am not home as often). Next to the kitchen, to the right, is my parents' bedroom. Their bedroom is a little large than my sisters. There are a lot of religious items in their room, since my parents are practicing Catholics. They have crosses, images of the Virgin Mary and Jesus as well as other saints, and also rosaries hung up around the walls or on top of their drawers. Their room is brown or tan, like much of the rest of the house. They also have a large closet against one wall that has sliding mirror doors (this is the same for my sister's room).

I was not not anxious about school or the stress I would get returning to school after thanksgiving break and that felt really nice. I was with my mom and dad and they were also having a good time just being with family. My dad is sick at the moment so it is really nice to have moments when it feels like everything is normal again. I was happy because I haven't seen my family in a really long time, and I miss them a ton being away from school. I think about my family all the time, so having them face to face made me calm. We sat around the fire and watched Christmas movies while enjoying thanksgiving left overs. It is a very simple event but I get a lot of joy out of being able to just relax with my family because when I was younger I did not appreciate it as much. I felt a warm pit in my heart, and again, I loved the fact that I was not anxious about anything. Time truly seemed infinite, and I have not had moments like that in a while with my family. My newly wed sister was there with her husband, and I was so happy to see that she was in love. I love my sisters a ton, and if they are happy, that makes me even happier.

We had very low expectations, since we had been knocked out of the playoffs in the first round each of the last three years. I had to change positions,because my coach and i did not get along very well. She was new at the time. I had to learn how to play goalkeeper in about 4 months which was a tough task. I had a tough start to the year, but as the year progressed i got better and better. We got the #5 seed in the state and won our first two playoff games by a combined score of 10-1. Getting the shutout in the second game against the #2 team in state was a great accomplishment for me. When we moved on to the semifinals, we were matched up against the #1 team in state, that beat us 6-0 the first game of the year. We gave up two early goals in the first ten minutes of the match, but this was by far my best game. I ""stood on my head"" as some people say. Despite losing 2-1 and not making it on to the finals, I was very happy with my performance. I was, of course, under the impression that this would not be my last competitive match played. I had aspirations to play in college. Unfortunately, due to injury and other circumstances, I could not play after high school. It was disappointing for me to make it so far, but not be aware that the last game I played was in fact my last game. I wish I had a better understanding of when that event was going to happen. But, it does shed a different light on that last game I had in high school. We had made it to the semifinals for the first time in 6 years, and people at my school were actually excited about soccer. I was glad that my school and classmates got more involved and cared more about our soccer team, because it meant that we meant something to people beyond just my teammates. On a personal note, despite losing, people always asked me why I wasn't satisfied with myself even though i was playing so well at the end of the season. I wanted to win the championship so badly.

I visited my grandparents because they live in India and they were my best friend's neighbor. After my best friend passed away I wanted to create something for her that would allow the people who loved her to be able to see something that reminded them of her. In India most people live in apartments and because of this there are a lot of terraces in the city. I decided to paint a mural on the top of the terrace where other people from neighboring apartment buildings would be able to see her name and memorial. What made me happy about the event was that I was able to commemorate my best friend in a very special and unique way. I met her in that apartment building when I was only 4 years old and when she was only 2 years old. Every summer I would visit India we would play together and that's why I have such beautiful childhood memories associated with that particular apartment building. I felt that the best way to commemorate her would be to paint a mural for her at the top of this building so that if she were looking down on us she would be able to see the mural herself.

I did feel crazy and I felt really bad to this that he would do somethig like that to me or that they would. To learn that I was right made me feel very foolish and embarrassed. I was very mad when I founf out and i drove to the place he was house dsitting. I told him to come out and I got very angry with him. It escalated and I hit him really hard. I dont think it hurt him but the gesture of disrespect and violence was shocking to both of us. I was so angry at him and at myself for trusting him that it felt like I could not control my actions. I was very out of control in that moment and it scared me. And I think that even though we were no longer dating it felt like a violation of that that kind because it felt as though the infidelity started long before the action actually happened. I felt betrayed by him and betrayed by them,. It was an awful feeling. I felt very ashamed for some reason and I still dont know why that is. Maybe it's because I felt stupid for being friends or being nice to the kind of peope that would do that to me. In retrospect I should be grateful for the instance because I learned who my real friends were. Even friends that were not directly involved with the incindent showed there true colors in how they reacted to my anger. Some of my friend sympathized with me and said they would have felt just as upset while other friends belittled my reaction and said that no matter what violence is not acceptable.

I saw a mountain lion right outside of my window, hundreds of giraffe, 80 year old elephants, mountains that stretched forever. I was not stressed about school or the future, only thinking about how beautiful the world really is. I was also considering where I was at, compared to the USA Tanzania is a place that has very admirable values and cares about what really should matter. It influenced what I should prioritize in my life and overall just made me happy that I got to experience that. I loved how I was also outside of my comfort zone. During this program I was able to learn Swahili and take classes about the economy in the country. Something about travelling motivates me to want to learn more and try harder generally. It is amazing how people around the world are so different from us and that makes me feel at peace and excited that we are in a bubble where we live and need to explore more. It also makes me feel like I am missing out when I am stuck at school when I could be travelling and living in places that have so many other things to teach me.

During college applications season, I was very worried that I would not get into a good school. This stressed instilled a constant fear of failure. When I received my acceptance letter, the weight of the stress was finally lifted because I had gotten into the school of my dreams, which was both the best academic and personality fit for me. All of a sudden, I was excited for the unknown future ahead of me. I had a slight idea of what to expect. One thing that I knew for sure was that CMC students feel like they belong and they are all extremely happy. I guess I was happy knowing that I would be happy in college. That is why I was so happy.

It was reminiscent of the color purple. In the living room mirrors covered the entire wall on the right side and there was wood paneling on the floor. There was a LaZ boy recliner and a couch, both of which faced a tv. Behind it was a coffee table we often did puzzles at. To the left was the kitchen and further in was the dining room table. Just behind the dining room table was a sliding glass door that led to a patio with a jacuzzi that no longer functioned as well as a laundry room. Then past the patio was dirt and vines and an old car that belonged to my uncle. Back inside the house in front of the dining room was my moms small office, with just a chair and a desk. All the way at the end of the hallway was my room, with purple and green painted walls. There was a blue bookcase next to my closet with all my favorite books in it and then my bed next to it with a spring themed comforter atop it. Next to my bedroom was a bathroom, and next to that was my moms room. She had a king sized water bed that filled up most of the room. She also had a tiny closet. Out in the backyard again, there were many stuffed animals that my dog, Radar buried, with only their heads above the ground. Right next to the gate was a hay bale and further around the back was a shed that I never went in. On the opposite side of the yard was a bundle of rose bushes, which immediately died whenever winter came around yet they somehow always came back to life afterwards. The front yard had gravel in it, and we lived on a culdesac.

My boyfriend ended up throwing me a surprise party and invited all of them. None of them brought a single card, but they all ate and left soon after.

The immediate event that pops into mind is last winter, when amidst snow and flurries I was out late at night drinking cocktails with my high school friends. The reason this memory is the first to be recalled, though, mostly has to do with the fact that college social life is pretty boring and I miss being able to go out to bars without worrying about age restrictions. I also have low tolerance for heat, so after Fall semester when the heat gets semi-unbearable the coolness of South Korean winter is such a welcome change. Just to provide more detail, I had planned to meet my best friend from high school months before I went back to Korea for winter break, and had woken up that day already excited. I dressed in the best clothes I had at the moment - a black open shoulder shirt with long tight pants - and met with my friend at Hong Dae Street, one of the go-to places for young adults to play in South Korea. We met around 12pm, just in time for lunch, and spent two hours eating and catching up. We then mostly scoured the streets, going into a VR game station and competing in fake horse back riding (since both of us had done horse back riding in high school), buying earrings and snacking on various juices and ice creams. Around dinner time we had a quick bite of spicy rice cakes and proceeded to walk towards Hap Jeong Station, near which are various high-quality bars. I don't quite remember what drinks we had (but have it written down in my phone) but I do remember we ordered an array of sausages after our first drink and ended up loving it. After two drinks respectively we headed back to Hong Dae Street and went to a bar called T1/2, which is my favorite bar in the place. By this time the street had a thin layer of snow over it. We just chatted the entire day about everything from college to wanting boyfriends to the most random stuff. Overall, it was a bubbly, nostalgic experience where I got to enjoy everythi",1.373,572.161,600.106,6,441,228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,1,465,277,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Happy,Happy

I have always lived in the house which is the last one on the right on my road. I have always loved the house that i have grown up in. It is located in a suburb in Santa Fe, New Mexico, right off the highway. The house itself has been around for over 20 years. My parents bought it about 23 years ago right before they got married. It is also the only house that my father has ever lived in,in Santa Fe New Mexico. The inside of my house varies a lot from room to room. It has about ten different rooms that all connect to each other. On one side of the house, there are two bedrooms. On the other side, there are two more large offices. In the middle there is a living room, kitchen, dining room, sun room, and atrium. The sun room and atrium are both filled with plants. They have large windows on the side and on the ceiling that let in light for the plants to grow. All of the walls and decorations within my house are all very different. There are walls that are painted both red and yellow. Some are painted blue, and some are a white plaster. The style of the house overall is very laid back and old fashioned. I would describe it as very new mexican as well. Many of the walls have abstract art or colors on them. The furnitaure is all designed for comfort and relaxation rather then style or high fashion. All the rooms in the house stand alone execept for the living room, kitchen, dining room, and atrium that are all one big room together. The house used to be two separate builidings, but my parents decided to do an extension and blend the two buildings together. The inside if the house is very warm and comforting. All the colors are warm like fa",14.519,556.857,600.007,13,503,433,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,2,4,2,3,1,1,1,4,2,1,4,1,5,1,5,4,2,4,2,480,441,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,2,4,1,3,1,2,1,4,2,1,4,1,5,2,5,4,2,3,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Neutral,

My parents bought the house after I was born, and this is the only house I have ever known. I will probably remember the address for the rest of my life: 2827 Evergreen Point road, Medina Washington. Medina is a quaint neighborhood with well-kept lawns and iron gates. When you turn down the long driveway, the large yellow house stares back at you. The inviting green lawn hug the edges. As you walk inside you feel cozy. There is a staircase at the entrance, and the living room has fluffy couches and a sculpture that is apparently made by some famous artist that no one has heard of. Next we go to the sunroom, which gets its name because the majority of the walls are floor to ceiling windows. The room would be flooded with light in most places, but in Seattle it usually has pounding rain and streaks of water running down. Some people find it gloomy but I find it therapeutic. Next is the dining room. There is not much to see here, and we rarely go in there except for holidays or when family is over. Baby photos and my mom's collection of small glass animal figurines line the shelf. In the kitchen, my mom is usually alive with activity. This is the casual place where we all enjoy spending time together, plus nothing brings my family together like food does. Now we move to the upstairs, where the kids rooms are and my parents room. My room is quite interesting. When my parents first bought the house, the room used to be a storage closet. I suppose when I was born, my grandfather decided that the existing rooms were not fitting enough for me and knocked out the walls to create a larger room. The walls are very low and sloped, which is a very odd sight considering I am six foot two",15.651,15.651,600.207,1,531,283,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,1,3,1,3,1,1,1,4,4,2,4,1,4,1,3,4,4,4,1,340,166,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,1,3,1,3,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Neutral,

My brother and his wife live in Bainbridge Island, and I live in San Francisco, so I didn't get a chance to meet her when she was born. However, their first visit with her took place several months after she was born. I remember seeing her for the first time so vividly, and I loved her from that moment on. My three brothers, sister in law, parents, and dog were all there completely focused on the tiny baby in my brother's arms. She had on a pink onesie and immediately after taking her into my arms she fell asleep. She was the most precious and delicate human I had ever seen, much less held. Although she was too young to talk, she seemed to communicate non-verbally in a way that everyone understood. Her bright blue eyes held mine for what seemed like an hour, but was probably no more than five minutes. Within 30 seconds she had absolutely stolen the hearts of everyone in the room, and we all loved her instantly. After waking up in my arms about 15 minutes after falling asleep, she started smiling. It was amazing, she didn't cry or squirm, but seemed perfectly content with a complete stranger. After that day, I would have done anything for her. I was amazed by this tiny human that shared my blood, that my brother had created. After all the obstacles my sister in law had endured throughout her pregnancy, they had the most perfect baby I had ever seen. It all seemed so worth it, and I felt as though this one event had brought us all closer through none of our doing.
